Question 1 

* User Story: Is usually used in the Agile environment to capture a description 
	      of a software feature from an end-user perspective.  The user stories
		usually include type of user, what they want and why. 

* Test Case: Is a set of conditions and or variables that a tester follows 
		to check that requirements and functions are properly met. 
		It can be seen as a set of step-by-step instructions to verify 
		something behaves as it is required to behave.

Question 2 

I would suggest that the integration tests be done first, once all test cases pass,  
move over to unit testing, here automated unit tests can be introduced into the cycle. 

Question 3 

Load Testing 
Functionality Testing 
Reliability Testing
Explorative Testing 

Question 4 

From the begininning phases of the cycle.  The quicker they are involved in the process 
the faster test strategies can be built and prepared for when the develoment phase is done. 

This also helps a huge deal in the elimination of any area that could be unclear

Question 5 

For the practical case I would say 60 to 40, automation to manual
